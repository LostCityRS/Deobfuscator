## RE Tools

An all-in-one program to aid deobfuscating and refactoring all kinds of RuneScape applets.  
It isn't mean to be limited to any specific years and is intended to be comprehensive.

Options when deobfuscating are profile-driven, you should be creating a deob.toml tailored to that applet with any transformers you need for it enabled.  
Do not enable everything - techniques change and improve over time!

### Requirements

- Java 21 (LTS)

## Credits

- OpenRS2 (Graham), for which the design was based off and many transformers ported directly over from Kotlin.
- Zwyz, who worked on their own Java-based deobfuscator and allowed that code to live on here.
