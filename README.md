This tool is profile-driven, you should be creating a deob.toml for each applet with the transformers you need.

You need to have Java 21 or later installed to run this.

#### Credits

- Graham (OpenRS2): your transformer design philosophy was used as a direct inspiration, and many transformers ported directly over from Kotlin to give users more options.
- Zwyz: allowed their own Java-based deobfuscator to be adapted here.
